# stock-multistep-prediction-bert-lstm
A deep learning project for forecasting Apple stock closing prices using historical multi-company stock data. This repo compares transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa) with an LSTM-based model for multi-step time series prediction. Implemented in PyTorch with recursive forecasting and performance evaluation across multiple lags.
